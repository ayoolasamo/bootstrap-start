<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ayoolasamo/bootstrap-start/blob/master/Capture.PNG)

The demo of this project was depolyed on netlify it can be viewed by clicking the demo link above, while creating this little webpage I learnt about the use of bootstrap to make a very nice  responsive Layout of a page with so much ease. In addition i have impoved the the use of CSS to style a page. The famous saying is that practice makes perfect which is exactly what I would continue doing.
